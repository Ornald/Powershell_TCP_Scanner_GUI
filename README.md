# Powershell_TCP_Scanner_GUI
Full TCP Scanner with GUI based on Powershell

This simple tool:
-  Allow for TCP/IP scann on multiple ports
-  Is very easy to use
-  Doesn't require any powershell knowledge
-  Can be easilly copy-pasted or even rewritten if required
-  Doesn't require any 3rd party libraries
-  Allows for network reconnaissance

  ```
4. Fill IP address of the target device
5. Select port range
